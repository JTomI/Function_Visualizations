# Function_Visualizations

The objective of this project is to take functions with three dimensional representations, 
and visulize the function on a sphere. A given line cut is mirrored so as to be periodic, 
then it is mapped onto a circle. The circular mapping is then revolved about a chosen axis, 
so that it gains an aesthetic 3D form. By shifting our choice line cut and repeating the 
process, we get an interesting visualization of the evolution of the function.
